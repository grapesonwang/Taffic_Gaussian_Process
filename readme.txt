This is a help file for you to understand what we have done in the paper

 
Wang, Peng, et al. "Short-Term Traffic Prediction with Vicinity Gaussian 
Process in the Presence of Missing Data." 2018 Sensor Data Fusion: 
Trends, Solutions, Applications (SDF). IEEE, 2018.

Please refer to this github repository for the neat version of codes. I 
used to share a folder with my colleagues, but at that time I didn't 
manage to sort things out. Obviously, I accidentally put some of our 
codes for the following paper:

Wang, Peng, Qi-Bin Zhang, and Zong-Hai Chen. "A grey probability measure 
set based mobile robot position estimation algorithm." International 
Journal of Control, Automation and Systems 13.4 (2015): 978-985.

How to run the codes?

Just clone/download the codes to your local disk, and then open 
'data_merge_enhanced.m', literally you will get everything there.

You can also try 'data_merge.m' which is an earlier version, I will add 
more details here step by step.
